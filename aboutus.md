title: Computational drug discovery
---

###  Our Goals

Our goal is to develop computational methods of drug discovery to treat age-associated chronic disease, e.g. Alzheimer's disease. 
Drug discovery is long-lasting process with high ratio of failure. One key challenge to select the proper drug targets in an early stages. However, chronic diseases are often complex in causal mechanism and less likely to cure the disease by one or few targets. Therefore, we aim to develop computational methods for
* Disease causal mechanisms
* Drug target discovery
* Evaluation methods of potential targets;
* Precise medicine for patient stratification
* High-throughput screening methods of drugs

We develop new computational stratergies and methods to falicate drug discovery. 

### Our interests
* New algorithm for network analysis
* Early-stage target discovery methods
* Methods to screen compounds
* Alzheimer's disease and other chronic disease
